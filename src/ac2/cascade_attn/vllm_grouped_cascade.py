"""Install grouped cascade attention into a running vLLM 0.23.0 engine.

Stock cascade reads a shared prefix once per batch, but only when EVERY resident request
shares it (v1/core/kv_cache_manager.py:485), so G groups of 16 siblings each with their own
replay prefix never trigger it. This replaces three functions so the same kernel runs one
shared-prefix pass PER GROUP. The kernel maths lives in grouped_cascade.py and is verified
standalone against plain attention; this file is only the plumbing.

  build()                 derive groups from the batch's block tables, emit per-group
                          cascade tensors instead of the single-prefix ones
  use_cascade_attention() decide on total KV traffic saved rather than one whole-batch prefix
  cascade_attention()     dispatch to the grouped implementation

Deliberately NOT patched: the scheduler and SchedulerOutput. Groups are recovered inside the
builder by comparing leading block ids, which the block tables already encode -- requests
sharing a prefix share physical blocks. That keeps the change out of the scheduler's
contract entirely.

Everything is fail-safe: if grouping finds nothing worth doing, or anything about the batch
looks unexpected, the stock code path runs unchanged. Enable with SP_GROUPED_CASCADE=1.

    dummy-safe, not real: prefix length one block, page ids as the dummy table provides --
    kernels read valid memory and produce garbage nobody consumes; the capture's outputs are
