"""sp_dp_pad -- run a fixed global batch shape on a data-parallel size that does not divide it.

Why this exists (experiments/08_31_scratch_g10k_noaudit, 7 cluster A nodes = 56 GPUs):

    pre-drop rows   192 inflow x1 + 192 trained x16 = 3264      3264 % 56 = 16
    trained rows    192 x 16                        = 3072      3072 % 56 = 48
    PPO minibatch    96 x 16                        = 1536      1536 % 56 = 24

None of the three has a factor of 7, so no Ulysses / FSDP re-split makes them divide: every
dp-dispatched call on the actor (the seqlen balancer, compute_log_prob, compute_ref_log_prob,
update_actor) asserts `len(batch) % dp == 0`, and the worker's minibatch iterator asserts both
`mini_batch_size % dp == 0` and `per_rank_rows % per_rank_mini == 0`.

The fix keeps the SCIENCE shape byte-for-byte (384 / 192 / 96, two PPO minibatches of exactly
1536 real sequences, the interleaved order PPO(M1) -> Q -> PPO(M2)) and only changes how rows are laid
onto ranks:

  * PAD.  Right before a dp-dispatched call, the batch is padded to a multiple of dp with
    duplicates of its SHORTEST row whose `response_mask` is zeroed. The PPO loss is
    `token-mean` with an all-reduced global token count (agg_loss / forward_backward_batch), so
    a zero-mask row contributes exactly 0 to the numerator AND the denominator: the gradient
    is identical to the unpadded batch, not approximately. Forward-only calls (old/ref
    log-prob) simply have the pad rows' outputs dropped. Pad rows are marked in
    `non_tensor_batch[PAD_KEY]`; nothing between the dispatch boundaries ever sees them --
    the judge, the replay admission, the Q reward site, advantage estimation, the rollout dump
    and the checkpoint all run on the real rows only.

  * BALANCE.  The seqlen balancer runs on the padded batch (so its equal-size partitions are
    exactly the dispatch chunks) and the pad POSITIONS in the balanced order are remembered, so
    that re-padding for the log-prob calls puts each pad back into the chunk the balancer gave
    it. Losing the plan (a mid-step resume) only degrades balance, never correctness.

  * MINIBATCH IDS.  update_actor cannot split each rank's rows positionally into minibatches:
    3080 padded / 56 = 55 rows per rank does not halve, and 1536 real rows per minibatch is
    not a multiple of 56. Instead the DRIVER assigns every row (pad rows included) a minibatch
    id (`sp_minibatch_id`, a per-row tensor that rides through the ordinary chunked dispatch),
    apportioned so that every minibatch holds exactly `ppo_mini_batch_size` REAL sequences
    globally and every rank holds at least one row of every minibatch (so all ranks run the
    same number of optimizer steps and the interleaved Q step still lands after minibatch 1).
    The worker builds its minibatches from the ids (tensordict_utils.make_iterator_by_ids).

Gated by SP_DP_PAD=1 and additionally inert whenever the shape already divides: an 8-node run
of the same config takes the pre-existing code path unchanged, and a run that did NOT opt in
still fails loudly on a non-divisible shape (a silent pad would mask a misconfiguration).

Everything at module top is pure Python so the apportionment can be unit-tested without torch;
the DataProto helpers import torch/numpy lazily.
