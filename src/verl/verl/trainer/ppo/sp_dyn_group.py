"""Dynamic group size for the prover rollout.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
Normal training draws a fixed number of completions per prompt (``rollout.n``).
This module replaces that with a doubling schedule that stops early on prompts
which already produced a high reward completion.

    k = K_MIN
    round 1: draw 2**k completions for every trained prompt
    loop:
        score every new completion (Q wave for capped no-proof short rows,
        judge for everything else -- exactly the production reward path)
        a prompt stops if any of its completions so far has score >= THRESH
        if k == K_MAX: stop every remaining prompt
        k += 1
        draw 2**k - 2**(k-1) more completions for the prompts still running

With the defaults K_MIN=3 and K_MAX=5 the cumulative group sizes are 8, 16, 32
and the per round increments are 8, 8, 16.

WHAT "SCORE" IS
---------------
Every completion ends with exactly one scalar, the reward function's ``score``,
and it has exactly one generator per completion:

  * a ``short``-routed completion that hit the g cap with no ``<proof>`` is
    scored by the actor's own Q function in the pre-judge wave, and the reward
    function returns that grid value {0, 0.1, ..., 1} without a judge call
    (``ds4_finegrained_judge.py``, the ``sp_q_route_taken == "q_consumed"``
    branch);
  * a completion with no ``<proof>`` is scored 0 without a judge call;
  * everything else is judged, ``score = points/7`` with points in {0,1,6,7}.

So "Q >= 0.7 or reward >= 0.7" is one test on one number. There is no per
completion choice between a Q value and a reward. Q also saves no judge calls:
a consumed row has no proof, so the judge would have returned 0 without a call
anyway.

Measured on step 99 of 08_26_s192b40_g10k_noaudit (3264 rows): 1045 scored by Q
(values 0/0.1/0.9/1.0 on 310/215/224/296 rows) and 2219 by the judge path
(points 0/1/6/7 on 1131/135/166/787 rows). Under the 8/16/32 schedule with
threshold 0.7 the expected draw count is 18.0 per group against the fixed 16,
and 108 of 192 groups stop after the first round.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO
----------------------------
It holds the schedule and the predicate only, with no verl imports, so it can
be unit tested on a laptop. The integration (round loop, wave, judge, replica
sleep and wake, cache semantics) lives in
``RayPPOTrainer._sp_dyn_generate_wave_reward`` (ray_trainer.py).

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
    SP_DYN_GROUP     1 to enable, anything else leaves training unchanged
    SP_DYN_K_MIN     starting exponent, default 3
    SP_DYN_K_MAX     final exponent, default 5
    SP_DYN_THRESH    high reward threshold on ``score``, default 0.7

Every one of these must also be added to the forward list the experiment's
runner.py builds for Ray ``runtime_env.env_vars``. The trainer runs inside a
Ray actor and an actor does not inherit the driver environment, so a variable
that is only exported by the launch script reads as empty here and the schedule
silently does not engage.
