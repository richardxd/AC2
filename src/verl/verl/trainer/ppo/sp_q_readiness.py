"""Generative-Q readiness -- driver-side state.

Bookkeeping for the generative critic Q (the policy prompted with the problem, the partial
attempt and, when available, a reference solution; it decodes a value on the grid
{0, 0.1, ..., 1}) and for the readiness gate that decides when the critic's value at the end
of an action chunk may stand in for a full rollout. Follows the sp_replay.py pattern: a
torch-free, env-gated module whose state lives ONLY in the driver process. Everything is a
no-op unless SP_Q_ENABLE=1.

What it owns:
  * the Q-supervision FIFO B^Q: constant capacity C^Q=3,840, seeded from historical dumps
    (q_seed shards + manifest), online admission of >=8-valid 16-rollout groups, oldest
    (smallest q_replay_seq) evicted;
  * the monotone readiness table + pooled 5-step MAE window (gate 0.18 on both the pooled
    and the fresh individual error);
  * the question-wise FALLBACK reference bank K (add-once); the PRIMARY trajectory-wise
    reference is resolved per record at creation from the sp_replay buffer entry;
  * per-step routing: ready/audit draw (|A_t| = ceil(|R_t|/4), pinned rng) + budget caps
    stamped into dataset rows;
  * Q-prompt construction at the TOKEN level: context = templated statement
    prompt + attempt ids + "</think>" turn close + new user turn (instruction, with/without
    reference) + forced '<think>\n\n</think>\n\nQ value: ' prefill; free generation
    max_tokens=4, permissive grid parse, NO constrained decoding;
  * the per-step reward-site update (admissions, eviction, readiness errors/transitions,
    fallback-bank add-once, delta append) and the Q-training sample with the C_Q
    packing check (fail-loud);
  * the audit-lane calibration pairs: for one member of each audit group, the Q
    value that WOULD have been consumed -- measured at the cut state (prefix + g), not at
    the prefix -- against that same rollout's realized terminal judge reward. Pure
    measurement: it never enters targets, readiness, rewards, or PPO.

Persistence (the sp_replay resume contract):
  * q_state.json in every checkpoint dir: dataset-step cursor, q_seq counter, readiness
    table, MAE window tail, seed manifest shas.
  * q_state_deltas.jsonl: one append-only record per step (admitted records VERBATIM,
    evicted seqs, bank additions, readiness errors/transitions, displacement norms). On
    resume, deltas with dataset_step >= cursor are dropped AND physically truncated
    (atomic rewrite) before state is rebuilt.
  * The reward-site placement guarantees "delta k durable before checkpoint k exists".

Determinism: every draw is keyed (rng_seed, purpose, dataset_step[, ...]) via
sp_replay.rng_for. Requires SP_REPLAY_ENABLE=1 (the Q mechanism rides on the replay
dataset's (step,slot) stream and buffer entries).

# The legacy wording above asks for "the probability that continuing this attempt leads to a
# complete and correct proof". The TARGET it is fitted against is not that probability: `z` is
# the grid-rounded MEAN of the group's judge rewards (`observe_and_update`), and under the DS4
# fine-grained judge each reward is a continuous `points/7` rubric fraction, not the binary
# `points >= 6` correctness label the difficulty sampler uses. A group that scores 4/7 twice
# and 6/7 twice yields z = 0.7, which is not any probability of correctness. So the legacy
# prompt asks for one quantity and grades the answer against another.
#
# This variant states the quantity the label actually is -- expected rubric credit -- and keeps
# a HORIZON, because the labels are censored: every member reward comes from a rollout that was
# cut off at the response budget, so "if it ran forever" is never what was measured. It says
# "remaining token budget" rather than a hardcoded 50K, so the wording cannot go stale the way
# the legacy clause does when the response budget changes (e.g. to 100k).
#
# A SEPARATE variant, not an edit of the constants above: the wording IS the trained Q format,
# existing checkpoints were fitted on the legacy version, and there is no prompt hash in
# q_state.json that would catch a silent swap under a resume.

        the time Q admission runs they are cached and the source entries' later eviction does not

        back to the question-wise bank or to no reference, training on different Q contexts than
        the uninterrupted run would have. Pre-warming here makes the two paths equivalent,
