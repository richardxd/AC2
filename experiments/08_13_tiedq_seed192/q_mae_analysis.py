"""How Q's error relates to problem difficulty and prefix length, and what Q looks like
across a group of rollouts sharing one prefix.

Reads analysis/q_monitor.jsonl. Three sections, and each carries the control that makes it
readable rather than just the raw correlation.

TWO TRAPS THIS SCRIPT IS BUILT AROUND -- both would flip the conclusions if ignored.

1. THE TARGET IS THE GROUP'S OWN MEAN. Probe error is |Q(prefix) - z| where z = grid(mean
   reward over the group's valid members). So binning error by the group's own reward is
   binning by z, and |pred - z| against z is the calibration curve, NOT a difficulty
   relationship. Difficulty here is therefore LEAVE-ONE-OUT: a problem's mean over its
   OTHER groups, never the group being scored.

2. z IS A SAMPLE MEAN, SO IT IS NOISIEST AT p~0.5. Its sampling variance peaks in the
   middle, so even a PERFECT Q shows an inverted-U of |pred - z| against difficulty. Every
   MAE below is therefore reported next to a NOISE FLOOR -- the error an oracle predicting
   the problem's own long-run rate would still incur against this noisy target -- and the
   EXCESS over that floor is the only number that says anything about Q.

Difficulty is estimated ONLY from full-lane and audit-lane groups, where all 16 members
carry a real judge reward. A short-lane group's judged members are the ones that finished
early WITHOUT being cut, which is a biased (easier) subset -- using them would make every
problem look easier than it is.
