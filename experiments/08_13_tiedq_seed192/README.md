# AC2 (main run)

`08_13_tiedq_seed192`

**Paper reference:** the AC2 run (blue line) throughout the paper: Fig. 1, right panel; Fig. 2, first three panels (ready fraction and critic error); Fig. 3 and Fig. 6, reference line; Fig. 7 and Fig. 9; Table 4; Table 3; App. B (Fig. 19). Checkpoints of this run are the starting point of the value-function probes (Sec. 4.4, Fig. 4; App. A.4) and of the variants branched at steps 20, 40, 50 and 130.

## Description

Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 is trained with AC2 on FineProofs-RL, starting from the base model with an empty replay buffer $\mathcal{B}$, an empty critic buffer of prefix–target pairs and an empty reference-solution bank. The critic $V^\pi_\theta$ shares all parameters with the policy and is queried through the value prompt (App. C); it answers on the grid $\{0, 0.1, \dots, 1\}$ and is fit by next-token prediction to the rounded group-mean value $\mathrm{mean}_j(v_j)$, under both the with-reference and the without-reference prompt. Each step applies the first actor minibatch update, one critic update with a separate AdamW optimizer, and the second actor minibatch update. The critic learning rate is halved (down to a floor) after two consecutive steps in which the critic's parameter displacement exceeds $\sqrt{2}$ times the summed displacement of the two actor updates.

Each step draws $n_{\text{refill}} = 192$ fresh problems, each rolled out once to refill $\mathcal{B}$ (these rollouts are not trained on), and $n_{\text{batch}} = 192$ replayed prefixes, obtained by cutting a stored trajectory at a multiple of 10,000 tokens in $[0, 0.9L]$. From each prefix the policy samples a group of $g = 16$ continuations. Unready problems receive full rollouts scored by the judge. Ready problems receive action chunks of at most $b = 10{,}000$ new tokens whose endpoints are scored by the critic, except for $\lceil \alpha n \rceil$ of the $n$ ready problems ($\alpha = 1/4$), which are audited with full rollouts. A problem becomes ready when the critic error averaged over the last five steps is below $\tau_{\text{global}} = 0.20$, its own latest error is below $\tau_{\text{local}} = 0.18$, the critic has made a nonzero prediction on it, and it has a reference solution in the bank (a rollout with at least 6/7 judge points). The last condition, condition (3) of Sec. 3.1 (`SP_Q_READY_REQUIRE_BANK=1`), was enabled partway through this run: the logged metric `q/ready_require_bank` goes from 0 to 1 at step 42 and stays at 1. The condition only gates new transitions to ready, so problems that became ready during steps 7–41 without a solved reference remained ready. Branches taken at steps 20 and 40 inherit this pre-step-42 readiness state. Advantages are $\hat A_i = v_i - \mathrm{mean}_j(v_j)$ without standard-deviation normalization, the KL coefficient is 0, and the upper clipping parameter $\epsilon_{\text{high}}$ follows the adaptive entropy rule of App. C.

The run uses 4 nodes × 8 GPUs (32 GPUs), with the DeepSeek-V4-Flash judge colocated on the training nodes (one tensor-parallel-8 replica per node). Decoding-cost records cover steps 1–202 (Table 3).

## Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `runner.py` | Training entry point. Builds the verl PPO/Hydra configuration from environment variables, asserts the AC2 switches (replay, critic, interleaved critic update, learning-rate controller), writes the manifest and calls `verl.trainer.main_ppo.run_ppo`. |
| `q_dataset.py` | Training dataset class (`SPQReadinessDataset`): replay-prefix sampling, the empty-buffer fill at the first step, and per-prefix routing to full rollout, action chunk or audit. |
| `sp_agent_loops.yaml` | Agent-loop registry: the prefix-continuation loop (honours the action-chunk cap) and the critic-query loop (greedy, at most 4 tokens). |
| `build_cold_artifacts.py` | Writes the empty replay-buffer seed, critic-buffer seed and reference bank that the loaders require; run once before the first launch. |
| `run_attach_cluster_a.sh` | Launch script for the cluster this run was trained on: preflight checks, all training environment variables, and the driver launch into a running allocation. |
| `submit_cluster_a_4node.sbatch` | SLURM allocation for that cluster: 4 nodes × 8 GPUs with a Ray head and workers. |
| `run_attach_cluster_b.sh`, `submit_cluster_b_8node.sbatch` | Equivalent launch pair for a second SLURM cluster (8 nodes × 8 GPUs). Same training configuration, except that `SP_Q_READY_REQUIRE_BANK` is not set. |
| `compose_dryrun.sh` | Composes the Hydra configuration with the launch environment on a CPU node, to validate settings before requesting GPUs. |
| `refresh_dashboard.sh` | Render the training dashboard PDF incrementally with `ac2.viz`. |
| `q_monitor_dataset.py` | Builds a per-(step, group) critic-monitoring dataset from the rollout dumps, critic-call dumps and critic-state deltas in `run_data/`. |
| `q_monitor_report.py` | Validates that dataset and prints critic-quality summaries (routing shares, agreement with the judge, audit calibration). |
| `q_mae_analysis.py` | Critic error against problem difficulty and prefix length, with sampling-noise floors. |
| `q_group_structure.py` | Between-group and within-group structure of critic values (intraclass correlation, design effect). |
| `test_08_04_logic.py` | CPU-only tests of the critic learning-rate controller, the critic prompt variants, the reference-solution correctness gate and the empty-buffer bootstrap. `test_context_group_moves_together` expects a 75,000-token response budget and fails against the shipped 50,000-token launch scripts. |
| `q_build_common.py` | Shard-writing and checksum helpers imported by `build_cold_artifacts.py`. |
| `flashinfer_aot_warm.py` | Ahead-of-time compilation of the flashinfer kernels, run before every launch (required with rollout tensor parallelism > 1). |
| `setup.sh` | Per-node runtime environment, sourced by the launch scripts on every node: `setup.sh cuda-compat` adds the CUDA 12.9 forward-compatibility libraries on cluster A nodes with older drivers, `setup.sh cuda-toolkit` selects the CUDA toolkit and include paths for the judge's JIT-compiled kernels. |

## Running

`runner.py` is the entry point; it is normally started by an attach script inside a running SLURM allocation.

1. Install the environment with `install.sh` at the repository root. Prepare the data with `python -m ac2.data.prepare_fineproofs --out-dir <DATA_DIR> --split both` and `python -m ac2.data.build_rubric_map --out <DATA_DIR>/rubric_map.json --val-out <DATA_DIR>/val_map.json`. Place `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507` and `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash` (revision `60d8d707`) in the Hugging Face cache; the run is offline (`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`).
2. Create the empty artifacts once: `python build_cold_artifacts.py --out .`
3. Submit the allocation (`bash scripts/sbatch_env.sh experiments/08_13_tiedq_seed192/submit_cluster_a_4node.sbatch`) and attach the driver with `bash run_attach_cluster_a.sh <JOBID> [KEY=VAL ...]`. Trailing `KEY=VAL` arguments override the pinned environment variables.
4. Optionally run `refresh_dashboard.sh` to render the dashboard.

The SLURM and attach scripts are written for our clusters: the repository root, cache directories, data directory (`SELF_PLAY_DATA_DIR`, `SP_VAL_MAP`), account and partition are absolute site-specific values that must be edited. The attach and allocation scripts also use two helper files in this folder: `setup.sh` (per-node CUDA environment for the judge's JIT-compiled kernels) and, because rollout tensor parallelism is 4, `flashinfer_aot_warm.py` (flashinfer ahead-of-time warm-up run before every launch). The attach script refuses to start if the pinned judge revision is not cached, if the replay seed, critic seed or reference bank is non-empty on a fresh start, or if a checkpoint's world size differs from the allocation's (checkpoints are not resharded, so a run must resume on the same number of GPUs). `python test_08_04_logic.py` runs the CPU tests (no GPU or cluster needed).

## Results

From the paper:

- AC2 first exceeds GRPO's peak mean score of 18.50% at 0.79e20 Decoding FLOPs, compared with 1.99e20 for GRPO ($2.5\times$ compute efficiency), surpassing it at step 90 versus step 120 for GRPO.
- Peak mean score 20.57%, compared with 18.50% for GRPO.
- Mean score 16.41% at step 50 and 16.88% at step 60 (reported in the chunk-size and correct-only comparisons).
- The global readiness threshold is first crossed at the end of step 7; the fraction of sampled problems that are ready reaches about 70% by step 200.
- Per-step GPU hours against Decoding FLOPs over 196 complete steps (steps 1–202): $\widehat H = 6.11 + 27.41\,(D/10^{18})$, Pearson $r = 0.874$.
- Where complete records exist, the mean-length cost estimate falls 5.51% below the exact decoding cost for this run.
