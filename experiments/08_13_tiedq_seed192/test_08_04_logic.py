"""Pure-logic tests for the AC2 critic additions. No torch, no GPU, no cluster.

Covers the decision logic that would otherwise first be exercised on a multi-node allocation:

  1. `QLrController` -- the critic LR halving ladder (schedule, floor alert, streak reset,
     immediate halve on non-finite, resume via replay_step).
  2. `Q_PROMPT_VARIANTS` -- the registry, and the properties each variant must hold.
  3. The tier-1 reference correctness gate -- that `judge_pass == 0` entries are refused,
     `judge_pass == 1` accepted, and a MISSING flag treated as passing (frozen seeds and the
     judged_correct admission path are correct by construction and carry no flag).
  4. The cold-bootstrap draw -- empty buffer yields zero replay qids plus `n_replay` fill
     indices disjoint from the statement lane.
  5+. Wiring checks on runner.py and run_attach_cluster_b.sh: no separate-Q resharder, pinned
     off switches, critic config reaching the dashboard, the judge revision pin, split
     readiness thresholds, the TP>1 AOT preflight, the response-budget group, and checkpoint
     retention.

Sources are loaded by AST surgery rather than by importing `verl` (which needs torch/ray), so
these run anywhere -- including a laptop -- and fail loudly if the shapes they assume change.
