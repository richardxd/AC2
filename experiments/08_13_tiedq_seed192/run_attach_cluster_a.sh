#     buffer, critic buffer and reference bank (build_cold_artifacts.py,
#     SP_REPLAY_COLD_BOOTSTRAP=1); step 1's replay slots become trained cold_scratch rows;
#   * weight-tied critic (SP_Q_SEPARATE=0) trained by a second optimizer between the two actor
#     minibatches (SP_Q_INTERLEAVE=1) under the halving LR ladder (SP_Q_LR_LADDER=1); its
#     optimizer state is checkpointed as sp_q_optim/ in every step directory;
#   * readiness: tau_global = 0.20 and tau_local = 0.18, a nonzero critic prediction, and a
#     reference solution in the bank (SP_Q_READY_REQUIRE_BANK=1); chunk length b = 10,000 new
#     tokens; audit fraction 1/4; critic prompt "reward_horizon", both prompt variants trained;
#   * n_batch = n_refill = 192, group size 16, 50,000-token response budget, no length penalty
#     (reward = points/7);
#   * judge: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash at the pinned revision 60d8d707, not the cache's
#     mutable refs/main, because the judge is the reward function.
# The node count comes from the allocation's .info file, never a constant.

# ---- flashinfer AOT preflight: REQUIRED for SP_ROLLOUT_TP>1 -------------------------------
# vLLM's AllReduceRMSFusionPass -> flashinfer get_trtllm_comm_module -> JitSpec.build_and_load
# does `with FileLock(...): build(); load()` UNCONDITIONALLY, once per rank. Every rank of a TP
# group serializes on that one lock and each re-runs ninja, so startup costs TP x build-time --
# TP=2 ~4 min, TP=4 ~8-10 min, TP=8 >17 min, at which point the ranks parked at the c10d store
# barrier blow their 600s budget and the engine WEDGES. All of it at 0% GPU util, because the
# work is nvcc on the CPU. TP=1 never enters this path.
#
# JitSpec.is_aot short-circuits build_and_load to a plain load(), so building each module ONCE
# single-process and promoting it into FLASHINFER_AOT_DIR gives the SAME artifact with
# compilation fully enabled. Idempotent, so this runs on every attach. Alternatives that do not
# work: disable_custom_all_reduce and VLLM_ALLREDUCE_USE_FLASHINFER=0 do not avoid the path,
# and compilation_config mode 0 avoids it only by disabling compilation.
#
# The warm step MUST run with the same FLASHINFER_WORKSPACE_BASE the engines get, or it
# promotes into a different AOT dir, prints READY about that dir, and the engines stampede
# anyway -- a gate that reports success while protecting nothing. flashinfer derives
# FLASHINFER_AOT_DIR from this variable, and its default is HOME-based, which on this cluster
# would also write .so files against the home quota. Exported here (not just listed in ENVS

  # reinstate a length penalty with nothing in the log saying so. Setting it explicitly makes the

# Two jobs here, both about not losing a validation:
#   (a) FIRST ATTACH of a from-scratch run: validate before training, so the base model's
#       IMO-ProofBench score is this run's own step-0 baseline. Every later attach must NOT
#       repeat it (it costs a full val pass and would overwrite nothing useful).
#   (b) ray_trainer saves the checkpoint BEFORE validating, so a relaunch between the save
#       and the end of validation LOSES that step's val row -- not retried, and the next one
#       is TEST_FREQ steps away. Turn it back on for exactly that case: the resumed checkpoint
#       is a validation step AND metrics.jsonl has no val-* row for it.
