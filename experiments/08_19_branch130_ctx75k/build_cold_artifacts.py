"""build_cold_artifacts.py -- write the three EMPTY artifacts a from-scratch run starts from: the
replay-buffer seed, the critic-buffer (Q FIFO) seed and the reference bank.

The loaders (`sp_replay._load_seed`, `sp_q_readiness._load_q_seed` / `_load_ref_bank`) require
a manifest and at least one shard file even when there are no records (an empty shard is legal,
zero shards is not). This script writes exactly that, with the same manifest/shard/sha layout as
a non-empty seed, so the sha pins, `verify_manifest_shards` and the state-file drift checks
behave identically.

How the run behaves while they are empty:
  * replay buffer: step 1 has nothing to cut; with `sp_replay_cold_bootstrap=1` its replay
    slots are filled with fresh `cold_scratch` problems (full group size, trained), and the
    inflow lane fills the buffer from step 1's own trajectories;
  * critic buffer: records are admitted only from replay rows, so the first ones land at step
    2; until then the critic phase is skipped (`q/q_phase_skipped=1`) and the LR ladder treats
    the skip as a no-op (streak reset, no reduction);
  * reference bank: filled add-once from the run's own judge-passing proofs; with
    SP_Q_TRAIN_NOREF=1 a record without a reference trains the no-reference prompt instead of
    being skipped. Readiness stays false for at least the first 5 steps (the MAE window).

Copied from 08_13_tiedq_seed192. The branch run does not need it: it reads the parent's
artifacts (SP_REPLAY_SEED_DIR, SP_Q_SEED_DIR, SP_Q_BANK_DIR point at the parent directory).

Run once before the first launch:

  python experiments/08_13_tiedq_seed192/build_cold_artifacts.py \
      --out experiments/08_13_tiedq_seed192

Idempotent (no RNG and no input data, so the manifest shas do not move and a resume cannot trip
a drift check); refuses to overwrite a non-empty seed unless --force is given.
