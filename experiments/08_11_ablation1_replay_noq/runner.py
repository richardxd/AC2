"""Prefix GRPO (08_11_ablation1_replay_noq): AC2's replay buffer without the critic.

Same configuration builder as AC2's runner (08_13_tiedq_seed192/runner.py) with the
generative-Q layer removed. Each step trains on SP_REPLAY_N prefixes cut from the global FIFO
replay buffer and rolls out the remaining fresh problems once to refill it; every continuation
runs to termination, every reward is a judge score, and advantages are GRPO advantages within
each prefix group.

The critic is removed, not configured away: SP_Q_ENABLE must be 0 and the train dataset is
replay_dataset.py / SPReplayNoQDataset (AC2's q_dataset.py with readiness and routing deleted),
so there is no critic buffer, reference bank, readiness table, routing draw or second
optimizer. (AC2 with SP_Q_AUDIT_DEN=1 would also truncate nothing, but would still train the
critic.) Per-step generation cost is therefore higher than AC2's, so compare on decoding cost
as well as per step.

Everything else -- batch shape, buffer policy, learning rate, entropy control, response budget,
judge, evaluation -- is as in AC2 and is pinned by run_attach_cluster_b.sh; read the attach,
not the module defaults below, to know what the run used. Critic knobs are refused rather than
ignored (see the gates below), so an inherited export from an AC2 shell cannot make the log
claim a mechanism that is absent.
